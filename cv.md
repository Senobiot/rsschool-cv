Hello! My name Aliaksandr, 37 years old and I from Minsk. I have a higher education diploma of BSEU (Marketing faculty), but it is not related to the IT field. In 2020 i started learn front-end basics technologies uch as:
- HTML;
- CSS (include SCSS basics);
- JS (include jQery library);
- other necessary tools such as git and gulp.

> Today i have not expereince in commercial development, but you can see some my work and code examples at [my portfolio page on github](https://senobiot.github.io/portfolio.github.io/).
And now, I studying the free JS/Front-End course in RS School online.
I am absolutely sure that in the near future I will become a developer, because I am purposeful, consistent and most importantly for me, I really enjoy learning development. **My  English level** is A2, but I'm sure I can improve it in the process.
